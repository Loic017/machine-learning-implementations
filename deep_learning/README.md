# machine-learning-implementations/deep_learning
Deep learning implementations in Python with Numpy.

## Overview
Layers classes are defined in `layers.py`. The model in `models.py` holds layers together to make a model. Each layer contains its own forward and backwards, the model links these together. It also contains train and predict methods.

The way it is set up may change as the entire project evolves.

# Implemented Modules

## Layers
| Layer Name       | Description                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Linear           | Fully connected layer                    |
| ~~Conv2d~~ |  |

# Resources
The layers here take inspiration from PyTorch. Other relevant places include other DL resources like Stanford CS230, Statquest, etc.
